### How to use it
* **Any map** - Grab the map url, paste it in and your on your way. Plenty of great ones are shared on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/) every day.
* **Players** - Click a player to spawn them on the map, then drag them around as need be. Double click to rename & right click to remove.    
* **Spawn NPC's** - Select a name and icon from spawn menu & get them added.
* **Fog** - Click to clear an area of fog, right click to re-add it. You can control fog opacity, clearing size or just turn it off in the fog menu.
* **Auto save** - Every action is saved to your local storage so you can quickly resume a game at your leisure. All saves are shown on the wizard.  
* **Player bar** - Click a player to spawn or focus on them plus reorder freely to match your turn order.   
* **Custom icons** - Just drag them in to the image picker and they will be available for all your encounters.
* **URL options** - Create maps using links,  use `map` for the image and `players` with a comma separated list users.
* **Local storage sync** - Allowing you to setup ambushes off screen by opening a second copy of the map on another window.

### Planned features
* Add more features to getting started.
* Import/Export - so people can share reconfigured encounters or just move them around.
* Ability to add overlays for injured or dead NPC's.
* More default NPC options.
* Set the icon size so they fit your tile system.
