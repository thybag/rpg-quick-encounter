**Grab a map** To start, grab a map image you'd like to use. Plenty of great ones are shared on https://www.reddit.com/r/dndmaps/

#### How to use it
**Players:** Click a player to spawn them on the map, then drag them around as need be. Double click to rename.   
**Spawn NPC's:** Just select name/image from spawn menu and drag them as need be.   
**Fog:** click to clear an area of fog, right click to re-add it. You can control fog opacity, clearing size or just turn it off in the fog menu.   
**Auto save:** every action is saved to your local storage so you can quickly resume a game at your leisure.   
**Player bar** Click a player to spawn or focus on them & reorder freely to match turn order.   

#### Planned features
* Better getting started wizard
* Import/Export - so people can share reconfigured encounters or just move them around.
* Ability Drag/drop  local maps and images, rather than needing to hotlink them.
* Custom NPC/player/monster icons
* Ability to add overlays for injured or dead NPC's.
* Proper dialogs - currently I'm slumming it with conform/prompts.

Made possible by the great work in;
* [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - Powering the maps themselves
* [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) - Build tooling
* [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) - Clever GeoJson tools.
* [Kenny's](https://www.kenney.nl/) awesome free assets. 
* [Lump.js](https://github.com/thybag/lump.js) - Because this is a hobby project, so why not attempt to roll my own js framework.
